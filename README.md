# ips-page

A web-based tool to parse and display Apple crash reports (`.ips` files) in a human-readable format.

Currently, this repo provides two ways to view a given `.ips` file:

- Plain text, similar to the output in Apple's `Console.app`: <https://leptos-null.github.io/ips-page/text>
- A structured view, with semantic highlighting: <https://leptos-null.github.io/ips-page/structured>
